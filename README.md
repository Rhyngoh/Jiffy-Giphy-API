___

**The goal of this assignment is to use the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs of your choice.**

To use this application, click any of the optional buttons on the top to get 10 gifs to display on the page. If the buttons are not to your liking, you can add new buttons by inputting condiments into the form to the right side of the screen. This will dynamically generate buttons that you can then press to get gifs related to your search term. Click on any of the images to make the gif animated. To stop animated gifs, click the image again to make it still. 

Remember: Condiments are anything that is added to food to impart a particular flavor, to enhance its flavor, or to complement a dish. (Spices, sauces, or preparation materials)
